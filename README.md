# tino's Neovim configuration

This is my custom configuration for *Neovim*.  
I use LazyVim (refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation)), so this config was created starting with LazyVim starting point.

## How to use this config

These instructions are meant for Linux and MacOS. For Windows, you're on your
own.

1. Install [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for your OS:
    - MacOS: `brew install neovim`
    - Debian: `sudo apt install neovim`
    - Fedora: `sudo dnf install neovim`
2. Install `pipreq`.
3. Install `fd-find`.
4. If you use Wayland, then install `wl-clipboard`, otherwise install `xclip`
   for X11 and MacOS.
5. Download this repository in `~/.config/nvim/`.
